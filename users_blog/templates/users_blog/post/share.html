                               We can render the form as an unordered list with "form.as_ul" or as an HTML table with "form.as_table".
                               On the other hand, if we want to render each field, we can iterate through "form". This is:
                               {°|° for field in form °|°} <div>{{field.errors}}\n{{field.label_tag}} {{field}}</div> {°|° endfor °|°} -->

            malicious website or program perfoming an unwanted action for a user on our site. -->
